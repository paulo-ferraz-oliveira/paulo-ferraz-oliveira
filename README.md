# Paulo F. Oliveira ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working as an Erlang/OTP engineer, though I'm also into Elixir and have experience
working with it.

I try to use some of my free time to contribute to Free and Open Source Software, especially
in Erlang and Elixir, but sometimes also in tools supporting generic development.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me

Search for "Paulo F. Oliveira" in the [the-eef.slack.com](Erlang Ecosystem Foundation Slack).
I'm usually open to a chat, especially if Erlang and/or Elixir -related.
